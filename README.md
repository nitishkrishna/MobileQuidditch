MobileQuidditch
===============
This is a Mobile Quidditch game for Android touch-enabled phones. 
The game can be played locally by teams of 3-7. 
The server is implemented separately here: https://github.com/skanda/Server-App

To play the game: 
1. Modify the phone source code (in this repo) with the details of your WiFi network (SSID+Password).
2. Install the app on your phone.
3. Run the Server.java code on a laptop that is connected to the same WiFi as the mobile phones.

The game can be played with NFC Tags, which can be used to "revive" a player back into the game.

A useful handout of the game rules can be found here:
